# Developing Data Products: Week 3 Project

## Instructions
Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. 
Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Review Criteria
1. Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?
2. Is the web page a presentation and does it feature an interactive plot that appears to have been created with Plotly?

## Submission
Use the "trees" dataset from the R Datasets Package to create a scatter plot using the plotly package

## Description of "trees" dataset
This data set provides measurements of the girth, height and volume of timber in 31 felled black cherry trees. Note that girth is the diameter of the tree (in inches) measured at 4 ft 6 in above the ground.
